                As a freshman I conducted research with Capra research group on <a
                    href="https://calyxir.org/">Calyx</a>.
                Calyx is a compiler infrastructure for languages that target hardware accelerators. Its control
                language is an alternative to other HDLs.
                In particular I helped work on the interpreter, which is written in Rust.
                <br> <br>
                As a sophomore I interned at Meta, working on the <a
                    href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/hack/src/hackc">HackC</a>
                team. HackC is the compiler for Meta's Hack language, which is an alternative to PHP. In particular,
                I wrote an
                <a href="https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/tree/master/hphp/hack/src/hackc/assemble">assembler</a>
                that helps verify
                that the compiled output of a Hack program is as expected. This project was also in Rust.

                As a junior I interned at Jane Street. My project was to
                extend an OCaml
                PPX to support a new data type. I will be returning to Jane Street
                in the fall of 2024 to start my career as a Software Engineer.
