                <p>Welcome to my webpage! I'm Alma, a senior CS major in the College of Engineering at Cornell
                    University. This website is the final project for ENGRC 3025, an engineering communications class.

                <p>My academic interests are mainly Theoretical Computer Science and Compilers. A few relevant courses I
                    have taken are
                    Graduate Programming Languages, Graduate Analysis of Algorithms, Introduction to Kleene Algebra,
                    and a Compilers class. As a freshman I conducted research with a group building a compiler for a new
                    HDL, and I have also interned at multiple companies on back-end projects. Check out
                    "Professional Experience" for more information!
                    <br><br>
                    Oustide of my major, I
                    enjoy reading, especially reading poems.
                    <a href="https://web.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/poetry/index.html">This page</a> has a lot of poems that I
                    like!
                    I also enjoy going to concerts, most of all for local Ithaca bands. I volunteer at a local community
                    kitchen and also with a Girls Who Code middle school class. I also love <a
                        href="travel.html">traveling</a> and
                    spending time in nature.
