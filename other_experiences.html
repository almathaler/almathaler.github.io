                I currently volunteer as a student-teacher for Cornell's local
                Girls Who Code middle school class. I love this role and think
                GWC lessons are a great way for kids to build community and learn
                some coding skills!
                <br> <br>
                As a sophomore, I worked as a teaching assistant for CS2112: Honors Data Structures.
                I also TA'd CS4820: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms from sophomore
                to junior year, along with CS4830: Introduction to Cryptography as a junior.
                Here are a few reviews from past 4830 students:
                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>Really great at explaining and making me think of solution myself rather than just giving an
                        answer. I go to all of her office hours because they help me so much!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="blockquote">
                    <p>I really appreciate Alma's help and she has a great understanding of the material!</p>
                </div>

                I am currently a senior, and one project I am working on is a <a
                    href="https://github.com/almathaler/KATSolver">
                    KAT equivalence checker</a>. This is my final project for <a
                    href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6861/2024sp/">CS6861</a>,
                and is based off of <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6861/2024sp/Papers/Pous.pdf">this</a>
                paper.

                I also worked as a writing tutor with the Cornell Knight Institute
                of Writing <em>Writing Center</em> from freshman to junior year, and also
                served as a Residential Advisor in Hu Shih Hall as a junior!
